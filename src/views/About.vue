As a way for us to provide mutual aid to our <span class="yellow-text">Community</span> through fire<span class="yellow-text">Arms</span> we decided to use our background and skills to create this platform.</p>
                  <p>We pride ourselves in being an inclusive <span class="yellow-text">Community</span> to those that may not feel comfortable in what can often be an uninviting environment for us. We are based in Atlanta but also operate in Central Illinois.</p>
                  <p> We are not an authority on the subjects we teach. Our aim is to provide a platform to share knowledge that has been taught to us, speficially knowledge we feel to be valuable and at no cost to you.
