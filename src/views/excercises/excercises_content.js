        <p>Many new shooters don't reconigze that the ability to smoothly compress & depress the trigger whether slow or fast is what ultimately determines an accurate hit on target.</p>
        Most handguns utilize a two stage trigger, meaning there is a certain amount of pressure required to move the trigger to what is often referred to as "the wall". 
        This wall then requires additional pressure for the trigger to move further and eventually break the plane where the weapon will discharge (trigger break).
        Pressure should be applied through the pad of the index finger, not the crease or tips.
        <br>
        <br>
        The goal of this drill is to try and understand where our wall is, how much force needs to be applied to reach it and where the trigger break occurs to discharge the weapon.
        For this drill we will focus on taking very slow methodical shots.
        <br> 
        <br>
        <ul> 
            <li>Begin the drill with your weapon on target and get in your sights.</li>
            <li>Place your finger in the trigger guard.</li>
            <li>The shooter should now begin to pull the trigger to the wall</li>
            <li>Once the wall is reached the shooter should ensure they are accurately on target, when ready the shooter should gently continue to apply pressure until the weapon discharges</li>
            <li>After the trigger breaks and the weapon discharges, the shooter should hold the trigger down and remain on target.</li>
            <li>The shooter should then release the trigger as slowly as possible. 
            As the trigger returns forward you should hear an audible click, this is called trigger reset, and at this point we are now at our wall again. Experienced shooters understnad this process very well and are able to return to the exact point of reset without hesitation which allows for them to immediately pull smoothly to discharge the weapon again (follow-up shots).</li>
            <li>Over time the shooter will develop muscle memory for this process allowing the shooter to more quickly compress and then reset the trigger.</li>
